### Context : 
Write a C++ program to read a sequence of characters consisting of characters ( and ) and identify if it is VALID or INVALID.Below is the definition of a VALID sequence.   1. The empty sequence (containing 0 symbols) is VALID.   2. If A is a VALID sequence, then so is (A).   3. If A and B are two VALID sequences, then AB (writing them side-by-side) is a valid sequence as well.For example, to see that (()(())) is valid, we note that it is of the form (A) where A is of the form CD, where C is the sequence () and D is the sequence (()); C is valid because if is of the form (E) where E is empty, and D is valid as it is of the form (C).Hint: To check whether a sequence is valid, it is enough to keep track of the count of (s and )s seen at any point in the sequence, when scanning the sequence left to right. You can use a few examples to understand when a sequence becomes invalid.Output: Your output should be of the form VALID N or INVALID N, where N = count of ( - count of )  for the entire sequence.

### Code : 
b'#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    string sequence;\n    cin >> sequence;\n\n    int balance = 0;  // Tracks the difference between \'(\' and \')\'\n    bool isValid = true;\n\n    for (char ch : sequence) {\n        if (ch == \'(\') {\n            balance++;\n        } else if (ch == \')\') {\n            balance--;\n        } else {\n            // Ignore other characters if any\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // If at any point balance is negative, it\'s invalid\n        if (balance < 0) {\n            isValid = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Final validity check: balance must be 0\n    if (balance != 0) {\n        isValid = false;\n    }\n\n    if (isValid) {\n        cout << "VALID " << balance << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << "INVALID " << balance << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}'

### Task :

### Options :
A. Reads the full sequence correctly from cin and handles empty input properly
B. Incorrect

### Code : 
b'#include<simplecpp>\nmain_program\n{\n    char c1,c2;\n    cin>>c1>>c2;\n    if(c1==c2)\n    cout<<"T"<<endl;\n    else if(((c1==\'r\')&&(c2==\'p\'))||((c1==\'p\')&&(c2==\'s\'))||((c1==\'s\')&&(c2==\'r\')))\n    cout<<"2";\n    else\n    cout<<"1";\n}'

### Task :
Choose the option which is most suitable for the above code for the criterion "Output". Give your output as a json with two fields : "answer" and "reasoning". Do not output anything else. Strictly follow this output format.

### Options :
A. Correctly prints the output
B. Some issue. 
C. Major issue.

### Task :
Choose the option which is most suitable for the above code for the criterion "Divisibility by odd numbers is checked and number reduced". Give your output as a json with two fields : "answer" and "reasoning". Do not output anything else. Strictly follow this output format.

### Options :
A. Fully correct
B. Almost correct
C. Tried in somewhat right direction
D. Totally wrong

### Response : The required output in json format is :


### Context : 
4.cpp       (14 Marks)Write a C++ program that accepts an integer N from the user and finds all the prime factors of N.Input Format:The input consists of one value: NOutput Format:Print all the prime factors of N from smallest to largest, each in the same line separated by a space.Constraints (Assume)2 <= N <= 10^6Note: Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:",cout << "The computed answer is", etc. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program.
