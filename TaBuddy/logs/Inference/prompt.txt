Problem StatementWrite a C++ program that takes a single integer N as input and prints the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula:Sum of N natural numbers = N ( N + 1 ) / 2Example: If N = 5, then sum = 5 ( 5 + 1 ) / 2 = (5 x 6) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15Input FormatA single integer N.Output FormatA single integer representing the sum of the first N natural numbers.Assumptions on InputInput N is a natural number.N is small enough such that the sum result fits in a 32-bit integer.NoteDo not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:", cout << "The computed answer is", etc. cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

Problem StatementWrite a C++ program that takes a single integer N as input and prints the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula:Sum of N natural numbers = N ( N + 1 ) / 2Example: If N = 5, then sum = 5 ( 5 + 1 ) / 2 = (5 x 6) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15Input FormatA single integer N.Output FormatA single integer representing the sum of the first N natural numbers.Assumptions on InputInput N is a natural number.N is small enough such that the sum result fits in a 32-bit integer.NoteDo not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:", cout << "The computed answer is", etc. cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

Problem StatementWrite a C++ program that takes a single integer N as input and prints the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula:Sum of N natural numbers = N ( N + 1 ) / 2Example: If N = 5, then sum = 5 ( 5 + 1 ) / 2 = (5 x 6) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15Input FormatA single integer N.Output FormatA single integer representing the sum of the first N natural numbers.Assumptions on InputInput N is a natural number.N is small enough such that the sum result fits in a 32-bit integer.NoteDo not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:", cout << "The computed answer is", etc. cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

Problem StatementWrite a C++ program that takes a single integer N as input and prints the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula:Sum of N natural numbers = N ( N + 1 ) / 2Example: If N = 5, then sum = 5 ( 5 + 1 ) / 2 = (5 x 6) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15Input FormatA single integer N.Output FormatA single integer representing the sum of the first N natural numbers.Assumptions on InputInput N is a natural number.N is small enough such that the sum result fits in a 32-bit integer.NoteDo not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:", cout << "The computed answer is", etc. cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

Problem StatementWrite a C++ program that takes a single integer N as input and prints the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula:Sum of N natural numbers = N ( N + 1 ) / 2Example: If N = 5, then sum = 5 ( 5 + 1 ) / 2 = (5 x 6) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15Input FormatA single integer N.Output FormatA single integer representing the sum of the first N natural numbers.Assumptions on InputInput N is a natural number.N is small enough such that the sum result fits in a 32-bit integer.NoteDo not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:", cout << "The computed answer is", etc. cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

### Context : 
Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.


### Code : 
b'#include<simplecpp>\nmain_program{\n\n    int n = 1234;\n    char a, b;\n\n    while(n != -1){\n\n        cin >> n;\n\n    if(n == -1) break;\n\n        if(n > 90) a = \'A\';\n        else if(n > 80) a = \'B\';\n        else if(n > 70) a = \'C\';\n        else if(n >= 60) a = \'D\';\n        else a = \'F\';\n\n    cout << a << endl;\n\n        if(n >= 60) cout << "PASS" << endl;\n        else cout << "FAIL" << endl;\n\n    }\n\n}'

Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program.

### Context : 
Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

### Context : 
Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

### Context : 
Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program.

### Context : 
Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

### Context : 
Problem Statement
Write a C++ program that continuously takes student marks as input till -1 is entered. For each mark, calculate and print the grade. Also print whether the student has passed or failed:
The grade of the student based on the marks:
A for marks > 90
B for marks > 80
C for marks > 70
D for marks >= 60
F for marks < 60
Whether the student has passed or failed:
PASS if marks >= 60
FAIL if marks < 60
Important : Keep on taking student marks until -1 is inputted by the user.
 
Input Format

Multiple lines of integers, each denoting a student's marks.
Input ends when -1 is entered.

Output Format

For each student mark input, output two lines:
Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
 PASS or FAIL

Assumptions on Input

Marks are integers in the range 0 to 100.
-1 is only used to terminate input.

 
Note

Do not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:
cout << "Enter a number:", 
cout << "The computed answer is", etc. 
cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. 
If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.

Problem StatementWrite a C++ program that takes two decimal numbers as input and prints them each separated by a single space.Input FormatTwo decimal numbers each separated by a single space Output FormatTwo decimal numbers each separated by a single spaceAssumptions on InputThe inputs given by the user will be from -100.0 to 100.0, both inclusive. NoteDo not write any C++ statements for printing general messages. For example, the following should NOT be present in your program:cout << "Enter a number:", cout << "The computed answer is", etc. cout should be used to print only the computed final output. In addition, do not print unnecessary spaces unless specified in the program. If any hard coding is found, or if any test case passes by merely writing a cout statement and without any logic, then the marks for that test case will NOT be awarded.
